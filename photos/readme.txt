assumptions made to tie the pictures from BSS to the only geotagged pictures from BSS provided with the data from the BSS Tree Mapping 2018.04.20 xlsx file.

inferring that the first three (BSS T1-3) of the xlsx file refer to the BSS-Staff and soursop photos.
so inferring that the remaining 4 under separate original naming convention are theremaining four plants referred to by hte xlsx.

why am i doing data fixing for them?
