OBSOLETED. 1000+ NUMBERS ARE TO BE REMOVED assumptions made to tie the pictures from BSS to the only geotagged pictures from BSS provided with the data from the BSS Tree Mapping 2018.04.20 xlsx file.

inferring that the first three (BSS T1-3) of the xlsx file refer to the BSS-Staff and soursop photos.
so inferring that the remaining 4 under separate original naming convention are theremaining four plants referred to by hte xlsx.

why am i doing data fixing for them?
END.

further information overriding the above:
based on the data combined by A.Mohess, I will manually rename the Brazil CZITT CORE folder images to the corresponding NUMBERSfield value, based on the planter name.
This should be correct, and will add a mock-beneficiary organization to allow an option to filter for the sake of demonstration.

..manual renaming of photos done, for photos/records 355-381, for the sake of demonstrating picture display in demo. will add demo beneficiary into beneficiary field to allow for search.
